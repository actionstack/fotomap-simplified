# Fotomap

Fotomap is an app that enumerates all the photos in your device's Saved Photos album and shows their location in a map.

### Exercises left for students:

* Add a camera button at the navigation bar and take a photo with the `UIImagePickerController`. Make sure that the photo taken is saved to disk in the device, and not only held in memory for as long as the app is running.

* Get the location of the photo taken with the `UIImagePickerController` by importing the Core Location framework into the Fotomap project.

* Create a `UITabBarController` and make it the app's `rootViewContoller`. One tab will be the map view, and create another `UIViewController` to display all the assets in a tiled fashion using a `UICollectionView`.

Answers can be found in the other repository, [fotomap](https://github.com/actionstack/fotomap), which is the completed version of this app. Click on the Watch button above to stay updated about changes on these two repositories.
